# I have created a comprehensive table for all the items available in the store, incorporating five columns to accommodate the necessary data. The inventory comprises a minimum of 15 items, and I have utilized select statements to arrange the items based on price and present at least one statistical detail regarding them.

# 1-Create a table named "store" with the specified columns: "item_id" (primary key of integer data type), "category" (text data type), "item_name" (text data type), "unit_price_usd" (real data type), and "quantity" (integer data type). The "primary key" constraint ensures that each "item_id" value is unique within the table.
 
CREATE TABLE store
(item_id INTEGER primary key, category TEXT, item_name TEXT, unit_price_usd REAL, quantity INTEGER);

# 2- This line inserts a new row into the "store" table. The values provided correspond to the columns in the table, in the same order they were defined.

INSERT INTO store values
(item_id,"category", "item_name", price, quantity);

#By executing these SQL statements, you would create the "store" table and populate it with the provided data.
